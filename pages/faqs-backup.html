              ROLDBLOX is a fan-made project by NotRoblox that tries to restore
              the classic Roblox look and UI so players can relive the platform's
              older aesthetic. Remember, this is not an official Roblox product.
              It's a community-driven effort to bring back the nostalgia of
              Roblox's earlier days. Players can expect a blend of classic
              elements and modern enhancements.

              ROHTML is a mod that accurately brings back the old 2016 ROBLOX UI
              to Roblox using an overlay made with HTML, CSS, JS and AutoHotKey.
              This makes it less invasive and easier to maintain than binary
              patches.

              ROVAMPED is a mod that changes Roblox to have a more old aesthetic
              to it by changing its modern icons to older icons, which can make
              Roblox look better in some ways. May be broken due to Roblox's new

              Mods are modifications made to a game or software to change its
              appearance or functionality. In the context of Roblox, mods can
              include custom UI elements, overlays, and other enhancements that
              aim to improve the user experience or bring back nostalgic features.
              And if you wonder, mods are completely safe to use as they only
              affect your local game client and do not modify the game server or
              your account in any way.

              No. ROLDBLOX is a community project created by NotRoblox to bring
              back the old Roblox feel. We're fans, not Roblox. This project is
              not made, approved, or sponsored by Roblox Corporation. We use a
              community project trying to recreate the classic feel.

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              Yes! ROLDBLOX is safe because it only affects how Roblox looks
              <em>on your own computer</em>. It works by replacing local files or
              using overlays, which means it simply changes the visuals and style
              you see, like colors, layouts, or themes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Important to know: ROLDBLOX does <strong>not</strong> change, hack,
              or alter Roblox's servers, your account, or the way the game itself
              runs. Everything stays exactly the same on Roblox's side - we're
              just adding a classic layer of nostalgia on top for you.

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              To keep ROLDBLOX safe, we recommend only downloading it from the
              official ROLDBLOX page or from trusted mirrors such as GameBanana.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you ever feel unsure about a file, you can run a quick antivirus
              scan or check the download with your preferred security tool. This
              helps confirm that everything is clean before you install it.
            </p>
            <p>
              We never ask you to enter your Roblox password or sensitive info,
              ROLDBLOX only uses local files or visual overlays, so the project
              stays safe for your computer and your Roblox account.

          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              No, ROLDBLOX does <strong>not</strong> inject scripts, exploits, or
              hacks into Roblox. It never touches Roblox's server-side code, your
              account, or the way the game itself runs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Instead, ROLDBLOX works safely on your own computer by using
              overlays, visual tweaks, and texture replacements. This means it
              only changes how Roblox <em>looks and feels</em>
              for you - nothing deeper.
            </p>
            <p>
              Think of it like a skin or theme for Roblox: it's all visual, all
              local, and completely safe.

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              No - ROLDBLOX does not break Roblox's rules because it never changes
              Roblox's code or injects scripts. It only works on your own computer
              using overlays and visual tweaks, which means it does not interfere
              with the game itself or with Roblox's servers.
            </p>
            <p>
              When you use ROLDBLOX as intended, it is safe and will not result in
              a ban. Think of it as a custom theme or skin for Roblox - purely
              visual, local, and harmless.

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              Yes - a few older mods are marked as broken or deprecated, usually
              because of things like DataModelPatch expiration or changes to
              Roblox that make them stop working. These versions are still kept
              for archival purposes, so you can look back at them even if they are
              no longer fully usable.
            </p>
            <p>
              Examples include the ROLDBLOX 2016 mod, the ROLDBLOX 2006 mod, and
              possibly ROVAMPED in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the other hand, ROHTML will not break because it works as an
              overlay. It does not rely on Roblox's assets at all, which makes it
              much more stable over time.

          <div class="faq-question">
            <span>What does 'DataModelPatch (DMP) expiration' mean?</span>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              'DataModelPatch expiration' is what happens when Roblox updates the
              platform in a way that breaks older patches. These are models that
              adjust or replace parts of the Roblox interface.
            </p>
            <p>
              When a patch expires, it stops working until someone rewrites it to
              match the new platform changes. This is why some older mods may
              suddenly stop working or be marked as broken or deprecated.
            </p>
            <p>
              In short - DMP expiration is not caused by ROLDBLOX itself, but by
              Roblox updating and changing things in the background. Until the
              patch is updated, the mod that uses it may no longer function.

            <p>
              You can download ROLDBLOX mods directly from the official "Mods"
              page on the ROLDBLOX website, or from trusted community mirrors such
              as GameBanana.
            </p>
            <p>
              We always recommend using these official sources to make sure the
              files are safe and up to date. Avoid random links or unofficial
              sites - if you're ever unsure, stick to the official ROLDBLOX page
              or GameBanana for peace of mind.
            </p>
            <p>
              These downloads only include local files and overlays, so they do
              not change or interact with Roblox's servers in any way.

            <p>
              No - you should only download mods from the trusted ROLDBLOX website
              or GameBanana.
            </p>
            <p>
              DLCfun is basically a ripoff copy of GameBanana, reuploading mods
              that belong elsewhere. Because of that, files there may be altered
              or unsafe, and you can't rely on their integrity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Using so-called 'unofficial' sources like DLCfun increases the risk
              of malware, tampered files, or unwanted changes. Always use the
              official sources we provide to stay safe and keep everything working
              properly.

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              Some mods may ask for elevated or administrator permissions - for
              example, RoHTML uses AutoHotkey, which sometimes requests admin
              rights to run properly.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is normal behavior for local overlays and tools that interact
              with your computer's interface. It does not mean the mod is unsafe,
              and it never sends data externally or touches Roblox's servers.
            </p>
            <p>
              As always, make sure you only download mods from official ROLDBLOX
              sources or trusted mirrors like GameBanana. That way you know the
              files are legitimate and safe.

            </p>
            <p>
              All of the changes are local, meaning they only run on your own
              computer. Mods like overlays and texture swaps simply change how
              Roblox looks and feels for you - they do not connect to Roblox's
              servers, modify your account, or touch your inventory.
            </p>
            <p>
              Think of it like applying a theme to your desktop - it's visual

              You can get support through the ROLDBLOX community - the main places
              are our official Discord server, the comments section on GameBanana,
              or other community pages linked on the ROLDBLOX website.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you run into a bug, the fastest way to report it is usually
              through Discord, where developers and other community members can
              respond directly.
            </p>
            <p>
              For smaller questions or feedback, GameBanana comments and our

              None of our mods collect data or have any privacy concerns. If you
              feel that a mod is unsafe to use, then you can always check for the
              source code or inspect the included executables since it is all
              open-source.
