            ROLDBLOX is a fan-made project by NotRoblox that tries to restore
            the classic Roblox look and UI so players can relive the platform's
            older aesthetic. Remember, this is not an official Roblox product.
            It's a community-driven effort to bring back the nostalgia of
            Roblox's earlier days. Players can expect a blend of classic
            elements and modern enhancements.

          <p>
            ROHTML is a mod that accurately brings back the old 2016 ROBLOX UI
            to Roblox using an overlay made with HTML, CSS, JS and AutoHotKey.
            This makes it less invasive and easier to maintain than binary
            patches.

            ROVAMPED is a mod that changes Roblox to have a more old aesthetic

            Roblox look better in some ways. May be broken due to Roblox's new

          <p>
            Mods are modifications made to a game or software to change its
            appearance or functionality. In the context of Roblox, mods can
            include custom UI elements, overlays, and other enhancements that
            aim to improve the user experience or bring back nostalgic features.
            And if you wonder, mods are completely safe to use as they only
            affect your local game client and do not modify the game server or
            your account in any way.

            No. ROLDBLOX is a community project created by NotRoblox to bring
            back the old Roblox feel. We're fans, not Roblox. This project is
            not made, approved, or sponsored by Roblox Corporation. We use a

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Yes! ROLDBLOX is safe because it only affects how Roblox looks
            <em>on your own computer</em>. It works by replacing local files or
            using overlays, which means it simply changes the visuals and style
            you see, like colors, layouts, or themes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Important to know: ROLDBLOX does <strong>not</strong> change, hack,
            or alter Roblox's servers, your account, or the way the game itself
            runs. Everything stays exactly the same on Roblox's side - we're
            just adding a classic layer of nostalgia on top for you.

        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            To keep ROLDBLOX safe, we recommend only downloading it from the
            official ROLDBLOX page or from trusted mirrors such as GameBanana.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you ever feel unsure about a file, you can run a quick antivirus
            scan or check the download with your preferred security tool. This
            helps confirm that everything is clean before you install it.
          </p>
          <p>
            We never ask you to enter your Roblox password or sensitive info,
            ROLDBLOX only uses local files or visual overlays, so the project
            stays safe for your computer and your Roblox account.

        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            No, ROLDBLOX does <strong>not</strong> inject scripts, exploits, or
            hacks into Roblox. It never touches Roblox's server-side code, your
            account, or the way the game itself runs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead, ROLDBLOX works safely on your own computer by using
            overlays, visual tweaks, and texture replacements. This means it
            only changes how Roblox <em>looks and feels</em>
            for you - nothing deeper.
          </p>
          <p>
            Think of it like a skin or theme for Roblox: it's all visual, all
            local, and completely safe.

        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            No - ROLDBLOX does not break Roblox's rules because it never changes
            Roblox's code or injects scripts. It only works on your own computer
            using overlays and visual tweaks, which means it does not interfere
            with the game itself or with Roblox's servers.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you use ROLDBLOX as intended, it is safe and will not result in
            a ban. Think of it as a custom theme or skin for Roblox - purely
            visual, local, and harmless.

        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Yes - a few older mods are marked as broken or deprecated, usually
            because of things like DataModelPatch expiration or changes to
            Roblox that make them stop working. These versions are still kept
            for archival purposes, so you can look back at them even if they are
            no longer fully usable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Examples include the ROLDBLOX 2016 mod, the ROLDBLOX 2006 mod, and
            possibly ROVAMPED in the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, ROHTML will not break because it works as an
            overlay. It does not rely on Roblox's assets at all, which makes it
            much more stable over time.

        <div class="faq-question">
          <span>What does 'DataModelPatch (DMP) expiration' mean?</span>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            'DataModelPatch expiration' is what happens when Roblox updates the
            platform in a way that breaks older patches. These are models that
            adjust or replace parts of the Roblox interface.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a patch expires, it stops working until someone rewrites it to
            match the new platform changes. This is why some older mods may
            suddenly stop working or be marked as broken or deprecated.
          </p>
          <p>
            In short - DMP expiration is not caused by ROLDBLOX itself, but by
            Roblox updating and changing things in the background. Until the
            patch is updated, the mod that uses it may no longer function.

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            You can download ROLDBLOX mods directly from the official "Mods"
            page on the ROLDBLOX website, or from trusted community mirrors such
            as GameBanana.
          </p>
          <p>
            We always recommend using these official sources to make sure the
            files are safe and up to date. Avoid random links or unofficial
            sites - if you're ever unsure, stick to the official ROLDBLOX page
            or GameBanana for peace of mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            These downloads only include local files and overlays, so they do
            not change or interact with Roblox's servers in any way.

          <p>
            No - you should only download mods from the trusted ROLDBLOX website
            or GameBanana.
          </p>
          <p>
            DLCfun is basically a ripoff copy of GameBanana, reuploading mods
            that belong elsewhere. Because of that, files there may be altered
            or unsafe, and you can't rely on their integrity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using so-called 'unofficial' sources like DLCfun increases the risk
            of malware, tampered files, or unwanted changes. Always use the
            official sources we provide to stay safe and keep everything working
            properly.

          <span>Do ROLDBLOX mods need admin permissions?</span>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Some mods may ask for elevated or administrator permissions - for
            example, RoHTML uses AutoHotkey, which sometimes requests admin
            rights to run properly.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is normal behavior for local overlays and tools that interact
            with your computer's interface. It does not mean the mod is unsafe,
            and it never sends data externally or touches Roblox's servers.
          </p>
          <p>
            As always, make sure you only download mods from official ROLDBLOX
            sources or trusted mirrors like GameBanana. That way you know the
            files are legitimate and safe.

            No - ROLDBLOX mods do not affect your Roblox account, your items, or
            your inventory in any way.
          </p>
          <p>
            All of the changes are local, meaning they only run on your own
            computer. Mods like overlays and texture swaps simply change how
            Roblox looks and feels for you - they do not connect to Roblox's
            servers, modify your account, or touch your inventory.
          </p>
          <p>
            Think of it like applying a theme to your desktop - it's visual
            only, safe, and completely separate from your actual Roblox data.

            You can get support through the ROLDBLOX community - the main places

            or other community pages linked on the ROLDBLOX website.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you run into a bug, the fastest way to report it is usually

            respond directly.

          <p>
            For smaller questions or feedback, GameBanana comments and our
            website pages are also great options. No matter which you choose, we
            always recommend using the official links listed by ROLDBLOX so you
            know you're in the right place.
